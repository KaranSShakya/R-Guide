* Create a repository at GIT. Click on 'Clone or Download' and copy the link.

* Create a new project on R-Studio through **Version Control**. Click on 'GIT' and paste the link. You do not need to create a seperate folder. 

**workflowr** needs to be installed through the console.
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
library(workflowr)
```

Register your personal information. Sometimes this is not required if R already saved your information
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
wflow_git_commit(user.name="KaranSShakya", user.email="email.gmail.com")
```

This code builds the workflowr folder in your existing folder or directory.
```{r eval=F, echo=T}
wflow_start("~/Desktop/working-directory", existing = TRUE)
```
